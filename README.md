# Introduction

A copy of the 100Devs ToDo App Template

"A Simple ToDo App is built using the MVC Architecture, we have also implemented "authorization" so folx can sign up, customize & personalize the app"

# Changes I Made

- Added titles to all views
- Saved html header of all views as a partial
- Updated todos.ejs
  - User is welcomed back with their username
  - Shows "thing" if user has 1 thing left to do, or "things" if user has 0 or more than 1 thing left to do
